# Nitro Toolkit

A collection of host-side utilities for working with AWS Nitro Enclaves. These tools help manage credentials, logging, and networking for Nitro Enclaves.

## Components

### Credential Requester

A Python-based service that securely handles AWS credential management for Nitro Enclaves.

#### Features
- Retrieves AWS credentials using IMDSv2
- Handles SecretsManager requests
- Supports vsock communication with enclaves
- Multi-threaded request handling
- Automatic token refresh

#### Usage
```bash
# Build the Docker image from the repository root
docker build -t credential-requester credential_requester

# Run the container
docker run -d --restart always \
  --name credential-requester \
  --device=/dev/vsock:/dev/vsock \
  -v /var/run/vsock:/var/run/vsock \
  --privileged \
  -e PORT=8003 \
  credential-requester:latest
```

### Logging

A CloudWatch logging solution specifically designed for Nitro Enclaves.

#### Features
- Forwards logs from enclaves to AWS CloudWatch
- Supports vsock communication
- Multi-threaded log processing
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Configurable log groups and streams

#### Usage
```bash
# Build the Docker image from the repository root
docker build -t enclave-logging logging

# Run the container
docker run -d --restart always \
  --name enclave-logging \
  --device=/dev/vsock:/dev/vsock \
  -v /var/run/vsock:/var/run/vsock \
  --privileged \
  -e VSOCK_PORT=8011 \
  -e LOG_GROUP=/aws/nitro-enclaves/my-enclave \
  -e LOG_STREAM=enclave-logs \
  -e AWS_REGION=us-east-2 \
  enclave-logging:latest
```

### Traffic Forwarder

A Python utility for forwarding network traffic between Nitro Enclaves and external services.

#### Features
- Bidirectional traffic forwarding
- Support for both TCP and VSOCK protocols
- Configurable endpoints
- Partial-write and backpressure handling without dropping unsent bytes
- Graceful half-close and connection-scoped cleanup on errors

#### Usage
```python
# Forward traffic from local TCP to VSOCK
python traffic_forwarder.py <local_ip> <local_port> <remote_cid> <remote_port>

# Example: Forward from localhost:8080 to enclave CID 3 port 5000
python traffic_forwarder.py 127.0.0.1 8080 3 5000
```

The 30-second timeout applies to establishing the VSOCK connection. After
connection, the one-second socket timeout is a shutdown polling interval, not
an idle or request deadline. A slow writer retains its pending bytes across
polls. Clean EOF propagates a write half-close so the reverse direction can
finish. A forwarding error stops both directions. The helper does not replay
requests or reconnect an existing connection; retry policy belongs to callers.

Connection log identifiers have the form `PID:sequence@CID:port`. This separates
helpers targeting different services when they share an enclave log stream.
`client->server` means local TCP application to VSOCK; `server->client` means
VSOCK to local application. `Peer disconnected` at INFO records EPIPE or
ECONNRESET with direction, operation and forwarded byte count. It does not
establish whether an application request succeeded, failed, or was cancelled.
Other forwarding failures remain ERROR. Payloads and raw exception messages
are not logged by the forwarding loop.

Run the standalone, offline socket and lifecycle regression tests with:

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest -v test_traffic_forwarder
```

These tests use synthetic data and local sockets. They do not validate the
Linux VSOCK driver, an enclave image, or deployed provider connections.

### VSOCK Helper

A utility for managing VSOCK communications with Nitro Enclaves.

#### Features
- Reliable VSOCK communication
- Automatic retry mechanism
- Configurable timeouts
- JSON request/response handling
- Detailed error reporting

#### Usage
```python
# Send a request to an enclave
python vsock_helper.py <cid> <port> <request>

# Example: Send a credentials request
python vsock_helper.py 3 8003 '{"request_type":"credentials","key_name":null}'
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenSecretCloud/nitro-toolkit.git
cd nitro-toolkit
```

2. Build the credential requester and logging containers from their component directories. The traffic forwarder and VSOCK helper are standalone Python utilities. See the individual component sections for specific instructions.

## Requirements

- AWS Nitro Enclaves enabled instance
- Docker (for the credential requester and logging containers)
- Python 3.9+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Proper IAM roles and policies configured for AWS services
